                    <p>Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents. Species of rats are found throughout the order Rodentia, 
                        but stereotypical rats are found in the genus Rattus. Other rat genera include Neotoma (pack rats), Bandicota
                        (bandicoot rats) and Dipodomys (kangaroo rats).

                        Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size. Generally, when someone discovers a large muroid rodent, 
                        its common name includes the term rat, while if it is smaller, its name includes the term mouse. The common terms rat 
                        and mouse are not taxonomically specific.

                        <dd>The best-known rat species are the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). 
                            This group, generally known as the Old World rats or true rats, originated in Asia. Rats are bigger than most Old World mice, 
                            which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over 500 grams (1.1 lb) in the wild.
                            The term rat is also used in the names of other small mammals that are not true rats.
                            Examples include the North American pack rats (aka wood rats) and a number of species loosely called kangaroo 
                            rats. Rats such as the bandicoot rat (Bandicota bengalensis) are murine rodents related to true rats but are not members
                            of the genus Rattus.
                            Male rats are called bucks; unmated females, does, pregnant or parent females, dams; and infants, kittens or pups. 
                            A group of rats is referred to as a mischief.
                            The common species are opportunistic survivors and often live with and near humans; therefore, 
                            they are known as commensals. They may cause substantial food losses, especially in developing countries.
                            However, the widely distributed and problematic commensal species of rats are a minority in this diverse genus. 
                            Many species of rats are island endemics, some of which have become endangered due to habitat loss or competition
                            with the brown, black, or Polynesian rat.

                            Wild rodents, including rats, can carry many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter.[6] The Black Death is traditionally believed to have been caused by the microorganism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis), which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is foot-and-mouth disease.[7]

                            Rats become sexually mature at age 6 weeks, but reach social maturity at about 5 to 6 months of age. 
                            The average lifespan of rats varies by species, but many only live about a year due to predation.
                            The black and brown rats diverged from other Old World rats in the forests of Asia during the beginning
                            of the Pleistocene.

                            The characteristic long tail of most rodents is a feature that has been extensively studied in various rat species models,
                            which suggest three primary functions of this structure: thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated
                            degloving response.[citation needed] Rodent tails—particularly in rat models—have been implicated with a thermoregulation 
                            function that follows from its anatomical construction. This particular tail morphology is evident across the family Muridae,
                            in contrast to the bushier tails of Sciuridae, the squirrel family. The tail is hairless and thin skinned but highly 
                            vascularized, thus allowing for efficient countercurrent heat exchange with the environment. The high muscular and connective
                            tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae, facilitate specific 
                            proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three-dimensional environment.[citation needed] Lastly, murids have evolved 
                            a unique defense mechanism termed degloving that allows for escape from predation through the loss of the outermost integumentary
                            layer on the tail. However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that have been the subject of investigation.
